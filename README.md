Dutch_to_English_Corpus compiles a dataframe based on the Dutch Parallel Corpus as developed by the Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal. 
Additionally, 60 sentence pairs created with the use of Llama 3.1 8B are added as a way to enrich the corpus.

The corpus creation was done in a hurry and is totally dodgy, a total of 15.000 sentence pairs were narrowed down to just 315 by using a hacksaw and ease of parsing.
This will in no way be enough for proper machine translation, but in time the corpus will grow to around 1000 sentence pairs.
